Princess Elizabeth Primary School  
Now we hear your call.  
As members we will serve you  
That teaches us all.  
Never from the good we stray  
We will always strive.  
Each at his best attempting  
Higher aims in life.  
  

**Chorus**

Princess Elizabeth forever  
None more loved can be,  
Harder ever harder  
We will strive for thee.  
  
Unity will be our best aim,  
Praise we'll always gain.  
Both in learning and in games,  
Merits obtain,  
Through calm or stormy times  
Each will do his best.  
Helping each other always  
Smiling through the test.  
  

**Chorus**

Princess Elizabeth forever  
None more loved can be,  
Harder ever harder  
We will strive for thee.
