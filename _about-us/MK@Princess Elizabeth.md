We are excited to share with you that MOE Kindergarten at Princess Elizabeth (MK@PEPS) has commenced operation from January 2023. 

MOE has been running MKs since 2014 to provide A Strong Start for Every Child. The MK Curriculum nurtures children holistically so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy. The feedback from the parents of MK children has been consistently positive, affirming that their children have the confidence and social skills to adapt to Primary 1.

The siting of an MK in our school will offer enriched learning experiences for the school community. Our students will develop social and interpersonal skills by participating in joint activities with the younger children. These joint activities are also opportunities for our students to showcase their learning to the kindergarten children and to exercise their leadership skills when they guide the younger children. Our school teachers will also benefit from a mutual understanding of educational programmes in the MK and primary schools. 

The MOE Kindergarten registration exercise for 2023 K1 admission has closed.  If you wish to place your child on the MK@Princess Elizabeth Waitlist, please fill in the form at: https://form.gov.sg/#!/620db865f620bd00132b67e8. Please note that you will only be contacted when there are vacancies available.
