On behalf of the school, a warm welcome back to School! We hope you had a restful and enjoyable December break and are ready to start the new year with enthusiasm and energy. To all our little ones who have just joined us in 2023, we look forward to knowing all of you real soon!

I am honoured and proud to be a part of a school with an illustrious history and a reputation for offering a well-rounded education that emphasises character development through our ASPIRE values, fostering responsible and self-directed learners who strive for academic excellence. As we embark on a new academic year, I am committed to ensuring that our students receive the highest quality education and support in a safe and nurturing environment. Every student has the potential to **_learn, love and lead_** and we must provide them with the tools and resources they need to reach their full potential.

It is a privilege and honour for me to join this wonderful community of students, teachers and parents to lead and serve as the new Principal. The team of dedicated teachers and support staff at our school, alongside the strong support from our School Advisory Committee, 3-PIE (Princess Parents as Partners in Education) and our parents, gives me confidence in our ability to provide an exceptional educational experience for all our students.

Together, let's strive for excellence and make this a successful and memorable school year!

Mr Bucktha Seelan <br>
Principal
