**Birthday Celebration**

MK will celebrate the birthday of those children born in the month on the last Friday before the month ends. Celebrations will include a cake, birthday song and pictures of birthday children. All children will enjoy the cake for snack.

Parents are discouraged from preparing food-related items for goodie bags due to allergies and medical conditions of children. Stationery items and story books are good gifts for goodie bags. Do plan wisely and discuss with the class teacher before making your purchases.

If your child has the following symptoms, please keep your child at home.
