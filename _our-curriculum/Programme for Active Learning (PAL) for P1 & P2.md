### Background of PAL

As the world around us becomes increasingly complex, competitive and inter-connected, there is a continuous need to ensure that our children are equipped with not just content knowledge, but also with the necessary skills and dispositions to thrive in the fast-changing and globalised future. We would like to see that they develop **self confidence, become an independent learner and a caring citizen to our society** in the 21st Century.  
  

### What is PAL?

With this as the premise, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has accepted the recommendations from the Primary Education Review & Implementation (PERI) Committee to implement PAL with the broad objective to further strengthen the provision of holistic education at primary level.  
  
PAL gives **greater emphasis to non-academic programmes within the curriculum as it recognizes such programmes facilitate well-rounded development of pupils** in the moral, social, physical, aesthetic and emotional dimensions of learning and provide another effective platform to develop life-skills via exposure to a broad range of activities from a young age.  
  
Under PAL, **all P1 & P2 pupils will participate in modular activities in two broad areas, Sports and Outdoor Education, and Performing and Visual Arts**. This will provide pupils with the opportunity to discover their various interests and talents, and the opportunity to specialize by taking a main CCA elective if they so choose at a later stage.
