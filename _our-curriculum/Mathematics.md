### Intervention Programmes


Every student is unique and learns at a different pace. We believe in giving these students the space and time to flourish.
  
Intervention programmes like iCAN and LSM develop students' confidence and readiness in Mathematics through appropriate pedagogies and a smaller class size.

*   iCAN (Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy)
*   LSM (Learning Support for Mathematics

  

### Enrichment Programmes And Competitions


We also provide opportunities for students who have a keen interest in Mathematics to participate in an array of enrichment programmes.


These programmes aim to provide a platform to challenge and stretch our students' mathematical thinking and communication.

  

*   E2K (Excellence 2000)
*   National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS)
*   Asia Pacific Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (APMOPS)
*   Math Challenges hosted by River Valley Mathematics Challenge
