<h3>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</h3>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools aims to enable students to understand
    the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
    mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships with others, including
    those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible
    decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the
    family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
    marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
    The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
    beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
    on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>(a) Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
    changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships</p>
<p>(b) Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
    sexuality matters.</p>
<p>(c) Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and
    others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality
    that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p>The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a) Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which
    are the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society;
    and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
    and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
    ones.</p>
