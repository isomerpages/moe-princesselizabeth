The school has adopted the ASPIRE (Ambition, Self-Discipline, Perseverance, Integrity, Respect and Empathy) values as the school values and they provide the internal compass for everyone to work and interact with one another. In Princess Elizabeth Primary School our CCE lessons are aligned to our school’ ASPIRE values to teach students values, knowledge and skills. We aim to inculcate values and build competencies in our students to develop them to be good individuals and useful citizens.  
  
Our CCE lessons are conducted in the official Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) by the Mother Tongue teachers. We believe that students enjoy CCE lessons when their daily life experiences are used as learning contexts to make learning more meaningful and relevant. This will allow the students to explore and internalize the values learnt and apply the values, attitudes and skills in CCE into authentic situation
