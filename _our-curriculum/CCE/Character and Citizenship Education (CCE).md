Through the PEPS CCE key programmes, we aim to develop our students to be&nbsp;**morally upright and resilient individuals of good character, caring citizens with a sense of active citizenship**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**steadfast leaders who are ready for the future**.&nbsp;

The Learning Our Values through Empathy (LOVE) Experience is the school’s Values-in-Action (VIA) programme that aims to develop servant leadership in Princess Elizabeth Primary School (PEPS) students via the value of empathy with emphasis on Awareness, Stewardship and Inclusivity. Adopting the Inclusive Design Thinking (IDT) process where they frame; empathize and define the problem for an identified group of the community, imagine; ideate plans to serve their needs, make; design and test solutions or prototype and share; present their solutions to the community, PEPS students have demonstrated better socio-emotional skills and this has resulted in a more enhanced social environment in class and in school.

The LOVE Experience aims to create a positive impact on students’ wellbeing by empowering PEPS students to make a positive change that results in achievement and success. The programme also develops active citizenship in the students as they empathise and help targeted members of the community. The entire process of empathizing, applying their new knowledge and finally trying to address the needs of the target audience enables students to find their VIA learning journey meaningful.

### TALK@PEPS
  

**Target Level**  <br>
Primary 1 to 6
  
TALK is important for two simple reasons - to be heard and to listen to others. Children, especially, love to talk. They cannot bear to be anonymous. However, it is often observed that when children begin to talk, it can be challenging to get them to stop and listen to one another. TALK@PEPS intentionally teaches PEPS students how to talk about Contemporary Issues on Active Citizenship in safe formal settings. Age-appropriate Thinking Routines are used to empower students to think and reason critically in a more structured process. Their sense of belonging and community is also increased via this programme.  
  
### National Education (NE)
  
**Target Level** <br>
Primary 1 to 6

National Education is developed in our students via the commemoration of the following 4 NE Days:

*   Total Defence Day&nbsp;
*   International Friendship Day
*   Racial Harmony Day
*   National Day

and via the Social Studies curriculum.&nbsp;The Social Studies curriculum aims to develop the civic competencies of our pupils from Primary 1 to Primary 6. Civic competencies, which encompass the body of knowledge, skills and values expressed in the Philosophy of SS, will empower students to be informed, concerned and participative citizens.
