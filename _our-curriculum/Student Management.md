<h3>Teacher-Student Relationship (TSR)</h3>
<p>Form Teachers have face-to-face interactions with students on a one-to-one
basis before or after lessons and during Form Teacher Guidance Periods
(FTGP) to promote Teacher Student Relationship (TSR). Form Teachers have
one-to-one interactions to build quality teacher-student relationships
by getting to know every student better. Teachers are also able to identify
students’ needs and nurture their character traits, dispositions, and attitudes.</p>
<h3>Student Recognition</h3>
<p>PEPS, being the Centre of Excellence (COE) for Character Development,
works towards developing character excellence in our students. Good character
is built little by little, day by day, through everyday lived experiences
and it requires every child to put in effort to be mindful of their words
and deeds consistently in different situations. Aligned to our Student
Well-being Framework, Student Recognition serves to affirm our students’
efforts in living out the school’s A.S.P.I.R.E values and using them to
guide them in making right decisions and exhibiting positive behaviours
daily. Students’ positive behaviours are regularly observed, intentionally
reinforced and celebrated by their teachers through many ways such as verbal
and written specific praises. On a termly basis, students are also identified
as Core Value Champions. They take home proudly the Core Value Champion
Badges and Cards which contain words of affirmations written by their teachers,
to share them with their family and friends. At the class level, a ‘STAR’
pupil of the term will be identified as well.</p>
<p>There will also be other class-based awards given to recognise students
who have improved in their learning attitude.</p>

<p>Apart from the aforementioned, the school’s annual Award Presentation
Ceremony (APC) is another platform to recognise students for their hard
work, effort, grit and success in all that they undertake.</p>
