<h3>Student Management</h3>
<p><strong>Princess Elizabeth Primary strategic approach towards enhancing discipline and student well-being is encapsulated in our ASPIRE framework.</strong>
</p>
<p>In Princess Elizabeth Primary School, we believe in nurturing every child
by guiding and helping him to develop his moral, aesthetic, physical, intellectual,
emotional and social domains to the fullest so that he would become an
Engaged Learner, a Caring Citizen and a Steadfast Leader.</p>
<p>The Student Management Department collaborates with other departments
in the school to ensure a whole-school approach by enhancing the well-being
of students and providing them a holistic experience in their character
development.</p>
<p>The school A.S.P.I.R.E. (Ambition, Self-Discipline, Perseverance, Integrity,
Respect and Empathy) values act as an internal compass for everyone to
work and interact with one another.</p>
<h3>Our Curriculum Goal</h3>
<p>Every Child an Engaged Learner, a Caring Citizen and a Steadfast Leader</p>
<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<p><strong>Positive Discipline:</strong>
</p>
<p>Positive Behaviour Intervention Support (PBIS) is a whole school value-based
approach used to help our students understand the rationale behind the
school rules. The students are constantly reminded that they should live
out the A.S.P.I.R.E. values, build quality relationships with their peers,
and look after their own well-being. The school rules serve as guidelines
for character development.</p>
<p>In Princess Elizabeth Primary School, if students have erred, the teachers
would bring them through a process where parties involved are encouraged
to discuss about problems and resolutions. This process of getting them
to work with others help students understand that it is important to see
from othersâ€™ perspectives when it comes to problem-solving. Students are
also guided through the responsible thinking process where they learn how
to weigh their options before coming to a decision. After which, the student(s)
will be involved in a self-reflection process. Teachers and parents/guardians
work collaboratively to support the child.</p>
