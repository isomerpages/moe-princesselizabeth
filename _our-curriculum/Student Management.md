<h3>Student Leadership Development Framework - Values</h3>
<p>Anchoring our Student Leadership Framework are our school’s ASPIRE core
values,&nbsp;namely&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>mbition,&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>elf-Discipline,&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>erseverance,&nbsp;<strong>I</strong>ntegrity,&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>espect
and&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>mpathy.</p>
<p>These six ASPIRE values, and their accompanying ‘I Will’ statements, serve
as a compass for every student in the school as guiding principles in their
leadership endeavours.</p>

<h3>Student Leadership Development Framework – Approaches &amp; Impact</h3>
<p>Three main approaches are adopted by the school in our student leadership
development.</p>
<p><strong>1) Executive Functioning Skills</strong>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helps in developing students’ self-leadership and Everyday
Leadership skills</p>
<p><strong>2) Servant Leadership:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Drives students to ‘<strong>Serve to Lead &amp; Lead to Serve</strong>’,
by contributing to class, school or</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; community</p>
<p><strong>3) Inclusive Design </strong>(Infused in LOVE Experience VIA Programme,
as part of our LLP):</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increases students’ awareness as they empathize with
others while helping them develop</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a growth mindset and important problem solving and
thinking skills</p>

<h3>4-tiered Student Leadership Development Programme</h3>
<p>Princess Elizabeth Primary School aims to provide our students with the
opportunity to develop his/her potential to be a steadfast leader. Since
2017, the student leadership development programme has evolved to better
meet students' diverse readiness levels, interests, and development stages.</p>
<p>As such, student leaders are developed through a tiered and progressive
development programme, which also considers the development of&nbsp; their
social-emotional competencies. This allows students to assume leadership
responsibilities that gradually expand in scope - from personal, to class,
to school levels.</p>

<p>Our 4-tiered programme aims to provide opportunities for students based
on their leadership readiness. It enables students to develop their leadership
skills in phases, ensuring that skills built at one level supported responsibilities
at the next.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Tier 1: Everyday Leader </strong>– This tier focuses on students
developing their executive functioning skills, working towards self-improvement
and self-leadership, where students lead themselves by living out the ‘I
Will’ statements. Focusing on self-leadership first lays a solid foundation
for positional leadership roles.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;Everyday Leader pic here&gt;&gt;</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Tier 2: Class or Subject Leader </strong>– This tier fosters a
sense of responsibility and promotes peer interaction and helping students
gain confidence in their leadership skills within class. Students who demonstrate
strong self-leadership are given the opportunity to lead within class,
as class monitors or subject champs.</p>
