<h3>Student Leadership Development Framework - Values</h3>
<p>Anchoring our Student Leadership Framework are our school’s ASPIRE core
values,&nbsp;namely&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>mbition,&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>elf-Discipline,&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>erseverance,&nbsp;<strong>I</strong>ntegrity,&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>espect
and&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>mpathy.</p>
<p>These six ASPIRE values, and their accompanying ‘I Will’ statements, serve
as a compass for every student in the school as guiding principles in their
leadership endeavours.</p>

<h3>Student Leadership Development Framework – Approaches &amp; Impact</h3>
<p>Three main approaches are adopted by the school in our student leadership
development.</p>
<p><strong>1) Executive Functioning Skills</strong>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helps in developing students’ self-leadership and Everyday
Leadership skills</p>
<p><strong>2) Servant Leadership:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Drives students to ‘<strong>Serve to Lead &amp; Lead to Serve</strong>’,
by contributing to class, school or</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; community</p>
<p><strong>3) Inclusive Design </strong>(Infused in LOVE Experience VIA Programme,
as part of our LLP):</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increases students’ awareness as they empathize with
others while helping them develop</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a growth mindset and important problem solving and
thinking skills</p>

<h3>4-tiered Student Leadership Development Programme</h3>
<p>Princess Elizabeth Primary School aims to provide our students with the
opportunity to develop his/her potential to be a steadfast leader. Since
2017, the student leadership development programme has evolved to better
meet students' diverse readiness levels, interests, and development stages.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As such, student leaders are developed through a tiered and progressive
development programme, which also considers the development of&nbsp; their
social-emotional competencies. This allows students to assume leadership
responsibilities that gradually expand in scope - from personal, to class,
to school levels.</p>

<h3>Student Recognition</h3>
<p>PEPS, being the Centre of Excellence (COE) for Character Development,
works towards developing character excellence in our students. Good character
is built little by little, day by day, through everyday lived experiences
and it requires every child to put in effort to be mindful of their words
and deeds consistently in different situations. Aligned to our Student
Well-being Framework, Student Recognition serves to affirm our students’
efforts in living out the school’s A.S.P.I.R.E values and using them to
guide them in making right decisions and exhibiting positive behaviours
daily. Students’ positive behaviours are regularly observed, intentionally
reinforced and celebrated by their teachers through many ways such as verbal
and written specific praises. On a termly basis, students are also identified
as Core Value Champions. They take home proudly the Core Value Champion
Badges and Cards which contain words of affirmations written by their teachers,
to share them with their family and friends. At the class level, a ‘STAR’
pupil of the term will be identified as well.</p>
<p>There will also be other class-based awards given to recognise students
who have improved in their learning attitude.</p>

<p>Apart from the aforementioned, the school’s annual Award Presentation
Ceremony (APC) is another platform to recognise students for their hard
work, effort, grit and success in all that they undertake.</p>
