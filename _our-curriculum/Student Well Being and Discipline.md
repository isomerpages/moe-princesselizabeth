### Student Discipline & Well-being

**Princess Elizabeth Primary strategic approach towards enhancing discipline and student well-being is encapsulated in our ASPIRE framework.**

In Princess Elizabeth Primary, we believe in nurturing the whole child by guiding and helping the students to develop their moral, aesthetic, physical, intellectual, emotional and social domains to the fullest so that they would become a lifelong engaged learner, a Caring Citizen and a Steadfast Leader. The Student Management Department collaborates with other departments in the school to ensure a whole-school approach to enhance the Well-Being of students to provide them a holistic experience in their Character Development.

Through the integrative programme, the school hope to develop our students into concerned and active students who would “Do the Right Thing” (Moral Character) and “To Each His Best” (Performance Character). As a result, the students would become discipline persons who would have discipline thought and discipline actions.

The school also adopted the ASPIRE (Ambition, Self-Discipline, Perseverance, Integrity, Respect and Empathy) values as the school values and they provide the internal compass for everyone to work and interact with one another.

### Our Curriculum Goal

Every Child an Engaged Learner, a Caring Citizen and a Steadfast Leader

### Key Programmes  
  
**Positive Discipline:**

In Princess Elizabeth Primary, a whole school approach value-based Positive Behaviour Intervention Support (PBIS) and restorative approach (RP) are used to help our students understand the rationale behind the school rules. The students are constantly reminded that the school wants to live the ASPIRE values, build quality relationships with their fellow school mates, and look after their own well-being. The school rules serve as guideline for character development.  
  
In Princess Elizabeth Primary, if students have erred, the teachers would bring them through a restorative practice session where parties involved are encouraged to discuss about problems and resolutions. This process of getting them to work with others is a good way to help the students understand that it is important to see from other’s perspective when it comes to problem solving. Besides using the restorative practice approach, students are also guided through the responsible thinking process where we they learn how to weigh their options before coming to a decision. After which, the student(s) will be involved in a self-reflection process. Teachers and parents/guardians work collaboratively to support the child.

### Teacher-Student Relationship (TSR)  

Form teachers and co-form teachers have face-to-face interaction with students on a one-to-one basis before/after lessons/during FTGP lessons to promote Teacher Student Relationship (TSR). During the session, the form teachers and the co-form teachers have one-to-one interaction to build quality teacher-student relationship through in-depth knowledge of every student. Through TSR, teachers are also able to identify students’ needs and nurture their character traits, dispositions and attitudes. TSR is also conducted during FTGP lessons.

### Student Recognition  

PEPS, being the COE for Character Development, works towards developing in our students Character Excellence. Good character is built little by little, day by day, through everyday lived experiences and it requires every child to put in effort to be mindful of their word and deed consistently in different situations.

Aligned to our Student Wellbeing Framework, Student Recognition serves to **affirm** our students’ effort in living out the school’s A.S.P.I.R.E values and using them to guide them in making fine decisions and exhibiting positive behaviours daily.

Students’ positive behaviours are regularly noticed, **intentionally reinforced** and celebrated by their teachers through many ways e.g. verbal and written specific praises. On a termly basis, students are also identified as Core Value Champions. They take home proudly the Core Value Champion Badges and Cards which contain words of affirmations written by their teachers, to share them with their family and friends. At the class level, stories of how these Core Value Champions demonstrated the A.S.P.I.R.E values are also read aloud to inspire and motivate their peers to work towards Character Excellence.

Apart from the aforementioned, the school also puts in place the Annual Award Presentation Ceremony to recognise students for their hard work, effort, grit and success in all that they undertake.

### Peer Support and Relationships  
Positive peer relationships facilitate the provision of care, a sense of belonging amongst students, as well as the building of resilience. Aligned to our school mission, ‘Together, we nurture and inspire an inclusive spirit’, our students develop the values of Empathy and Respect for one another through the active involvement in school initiatives and programmes which promote and drive Peer Support and Relationships (PSR) efforts.

The school puts in place Peer-bonding activities during periods designated for Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP), Teacher-Student Relationship (TSR), etc. To allow for greater opportunities for students to bond and know each other better, the Happy Breakfast Programme is recently introduced on a termly basis to afford for quality conversations amongst peers.

Curriculum learning and planning are also always centered on the need for students to have the opportunities and experiences in collaborating with each other. Through these interactions, students can apply peer-helping skills to support others too. This would also sharpen their ability to be effective communicators, active contributors and inclusive individuals making a positive difference in themselves and others.
