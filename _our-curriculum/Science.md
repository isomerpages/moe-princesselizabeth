Students are taken through 5 key stages of learning in the 5E Instructional Model - Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate – as they discover and reinforce the learning of Science concepts.</p><h3>Key Programmes</h3><p><strong>S.T.E.M FEST</strong></p><p>S.T.E.M Fest, a collaborative programme by the Mathematics and Science departments, was first launched in 2021 and aims to promote awareness of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) ideas and provide students with opportunities for discovery of STEM concepts through fun and engaging hands-on activities.</p><p>S.T.E.A.M. Fest 3.0! continued its run in 2023 with the theme ‘Improving Lives through Design’. Through design challenges anchored on real-life situations, students were provided with opportunities to build their creative solutions and test them out.</p><p></p><p><strong>Science Learning Journey</strong></p><p>Learning journeys allow pupils’ learning to be extended beyond the classroom, where real-life experiences can help pupils relate concepts learnt to situations they observe in the surrounding.</p><p><strong>P3 Virtual Learning Journey to River Safari</strong></p><p>Our P3 students engaged in a virtual learning journey to extend their learning of the animals classified into different groups. In a live Zoom session with the River Safari facilitator, students explored the movements of different animals and learnt about the characteristics of the different groups of animals, including mammals and reptiles. Students were also given the task of building cardboard models of animals as part of the hands-on activity during the virtual learning journey.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:70%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/2023%20Sci/Picture4.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:70%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/2023%20Sci/Picture5.jpg"></div><p>**P4 Learning Journey to Gardens By The Bay**</p><p>To extend their learning of plants and plat parts beyond the classroom, our P4 students go on a learning journey to Gardens By The Bay to observe a variety of plants and observe for similarities and differences among them.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2023%20Sci/Picture6.jpg"></div><p><strong>P5 Learning Journey to Singapore Botanic Garden</strong></p><p>P5 students observe, touch and feel a variety of plants and plant parts, as part of outdoor experiential learning.
