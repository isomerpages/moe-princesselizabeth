Students are taken through 5 key stages of learning in the 5E Instructional Model - Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate – as they discover and reinforce the learning of Science concepts.</p><h3>Key Programmes</h3><p><strong>S.T.E.M FEST</strong></p><p>S.T.E.M Fest, a collaborative programme by the Mathematics and Science departments, was first launched in 2021 and aims to promote awareness of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) ideas and provide students with opportunities for discovery of STEM concepts through fun and engaging hands-on activities.</p><p>S.T.E.A.M. Fest 3.0! continued its run in 2023 with the theme ‘Improving Lives through Design’. Through design challenges anchored on real-life situations, students were provided with opportunities to build their creative solutions and test them out.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 SC/STEM_Fest.png"></div><p><strong>Science Learning Journey</strong></p><p>Learning journeys allow pupils’ learning to be extended beyond the classroom, where real-life experiences can help pupils relate concepts learnt to situations they observe in the surrounding.</p><p><strong>P3 Learning Journey to Singapore Zoo</strong></p><p>As part of the Primary 3 One-Day Outdoor Learning Experience, our P3 students visited the Singapore Zoo. In an authentic environment, students explored and observed the different animal groups, sketched them and stated their unique characteristics. They made their way from one exhibit to another by reading the map and orienteering themselves. Students watched the Splash Safari animal show and learnt more about marine mammals too.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 SC/P3_LJ_to_SG_Zoo.png"></div><p><strong>P4 Learning Journey</strong></p><p>As part of the annual 2-days and 1-night residential camp, the outdoors set the stage for the learning of plants for our P4 students. Students were engaged in environment exploration at National Parks. They explored the variety of plants that can be found in our tropical climate and identified plant parts such as leaf, stem and roots.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 SC/P4_LJ_to_NParks.png"></div><p><strong>P5 Learning Journey to Singapore Science Centre</strong></p><p>Our P5 students attended the workshop ‘Electric Carnival’ held at the Singapore Science Centre. Through experimentation and hands-on activities, students explored concepts such as parallel and series circuits, electrical connections, conductors and insulators. They learned how common electrical components like fuses work, and how these are important in our daily lives. Students tried their hands at electroplating as well!</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 SC/P5_LJ_to_SCC.png"></div><p><strong>P6 Learning Journey to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve</strong></p><p>Our P6 students visited the Sungei Buloh Nature Reserve. Following the experienced nature guide, the students learned about the conditions of a mangrove habitat and the variety of flora and fauna in a mangrove. They also learned about the behavioural and structural adaptations of plants and animals that help these living things cope and survive in the environment they live in.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 SC/P6_LJ_to_SBWR.png"></div><h4>LOVE for Gaia Programme</h4><p>Our ‘LOVE for Gaia’ programme is in line with the Singapore Green Plan 2030, a whole-of-nation movement to advance Singapore’s national agenda on sustainable development.
