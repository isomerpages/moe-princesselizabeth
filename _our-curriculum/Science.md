### Vision
Students will be scientific inquirers with a sense of curiosity for the environment.

### Mission
To inculcate the spirit of scientific inquiry

### Approach
**Inquiry-based Learning**

Inquiry-based Learning (IBL) is adopted as a school-wide approach in the teaching and learning of Science. Students are taken through 5 key stages of learning in the 5E Instructional Model - Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate – as they discover and reinforce the learning of Science concepts. 
  
### Key Programmes
**S.T.E.M FEST**

S.T.E.M Fest, a collaborative programme by the Mathematics and Science departments, was first launched in 2021 and aims to promote awareness of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) ideas and provide students with opportunities for discovery of STEM concepts through fun and engaging hands-on activities.   

With the relaxation of SMM, S.T.E.M Fest 2.0, Refreshed! returned in 2022 and was designed and implemented to provide students with the opportunity to engage in face-to-face physical STEM activities.

###### Science Learning Journey

Learning journeys allow pupils’ learning to be extended beyond the classroom, where real-life experiences can help pupils relate concepts learnt to situations they observe in the surrounding.

###### P3 Virtual Learning Journey to River Safari

Our P3 students engaged in a virtual learning journey to extend their learning of the animals classified into different groups. 
In a live Zoom session with the River Safari facilitator, students explored the movements of different animals and learnt about the characteristics of the different groups of animals, including mammals and reptiles. Students were also given the task of building cardboard models of animals as part of the hands-on activity during the virtual learning journey.

Our P6 students go on a virtual tour to the Sungei Buloh Nature Reserve. The students learn about the conditions of a mangrove habitat and the variety of flora and fauna in a mangrove. They also learned about the behavioural and structural adaptations of plants and animals that help these living things cope and survive in the environment they live in.
