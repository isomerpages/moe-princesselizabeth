<h3>Head Of Department</h3><p>Mdm Nur Hazreen Bte Subadar</p><h3>Level Head</h3><p>Mrs Jeslyn Loh</p><h3>ST (Science)</h3><p>Ms Xu Huimin</p><h3>ST (HAL)</h3><p>Mrs Koh Qiuwen</p><h3>Vision</h3><p>Students will be scientific inquirers with a sense of curiosity for the environment.</p><h3>Mission</h3><p>To inculcate the spirit of scientific inquiry</p><h3>Approach</h3><p><strong>Inquiry-based Learning</strong></p><p>Inquiry-based Learning (IBL) is adopted as a school-wide approach in the teaching and learning of Science. Students are taken through 5 key stages of learning in the 5E Instructional Model - Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate – as they discover and reinforce the learning of Science concepts.</p><h3>Key Programmes</h3><p><strong>S.T.E.M FEST</strong></p><p>S.T.E.M Fest, a collaborative programme by the Mathematics and Science departments, was first launched in 2021 and aims to promote awareness of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) ideas and provide students with opportunities for discovery of STEM concepts through fun and engaging hands-on activities.</p><p>S.T.E.A.M. Fest 3.0! continued its run in 2023 with the theme ‘Improving Lives through Design’. Through design challenges anchored on real-life situations, students were provided with opportunities to build their creative solutions and test them out.</p><p>&lt;STEM Fest pic here&gt;</p><p><strong>Science Learning Journey</strong></p><p>Learning journeys allow pupils’ learning to be extended beyond the classroom, where real-life experiences can help pupils relate concepts learnt to situations they observe in the surrounding.</p><p><strong>P3 Learning Journey to Singapore Zoo</strong></p><p>As part of the Primary 3 One-Day Outdoor Learning Experience, our P3 students visited the Singapore Zoo. In an authentic environment, students explored and observed the different animal groups, sketched them and stated their unique characteristics. They made their way from one exhibit to another by reading the map and orienteering themselves. Students watched the Splash Safari animal show and learnt more about marine mammals too.</p><p>&lt;P3 LJ pic here&gt;</p><p><strong>P4 Learning Journey</strong></p><p>As part of the annual 2-days and 1-night residential camp, the outdoors set the stage for the learning of plants for our P4 students. Students were engaged in environment exploration at National Parks. They explored the variety of plants that can be found in our tropical climate and identified plant parts such as leaf, stem and roots.</p><p>&lt;P4 LJ pic here&gt;</p><p><strong>P5 Learning Journey to Singapore Science Centre</strong></p><p>Our P5 students attended the workshop ‘Electric Carnival’ held at the Singapore Science Centre. Through experimentation and hands-on activities, students explored concepts such as parallel and series circuits, electrical connections, conductors and insulators. They learned how common electrical components like fuses work, and how these are important in our daily lives. Students tried their hands at electroplating as well!</p><p>&lt;P5 LJ to SSC pic here&gt;</p><p><strong>P6 Virtual Learning Journey to Sungei Buloh</strong></p><p>Our P6 students go on a virtual tour to the Sungei Buloh Nature Reserve. The students learn about the conditions of a mangrove habitat and the variety of flora and fauna in a mangrove. They also learned about the behavioural and structural adaptations of plants and animals that help these living things cope and survive in the environment they live in.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2023%20Sci/Picture10.jpg"></div><h4>Environmental Programmes</h4><p>A variety of environmental education programmes and activities aim to raise environmental awareness and inculcate environmentally-responsible habits in our students.</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Recycling Drives</strong></p></li></ul><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:70%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/2023%20Sci/Picture11.jpg"></div><p>* **Clean Plates Campaign**</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:70%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/2023%20Sci/Picture12.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:70%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/2023%20Sci/Picture13.jpg"></div><p>* **School-wide sharing on environmental awareness by our Junior Environmental Ambassadors.**</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:70%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/2023%20Sci/Picture14.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:70%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/2023%20Sci/Picture15.jpg"></div><p></p>
