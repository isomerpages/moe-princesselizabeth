<h3>Focus Area: Innovation and Enterprise</h3>
<p>Using the inclusive design thinking approach in our ALP to foster in our
students the value of empathy and resilience, students learn to be innovative
and design creative solutions to real world problems which meet the needs
of people and environment in the process of ideation, experimentation and
problem-solving. The approach is an amalgamation of the culture of care
and innovation, and is a process that develops values and skills in our
students and staff through human-centered techniques to solve real-world
problems in creative and innovative ways.</p>

<p>Using Design Thinking approach, students interview their peers, school
attendant, the canteen vendors or community members to find out more about
their needs. Through this, students learn to empathise with their users
and thereafter create interesting prototypes in order to meet the users'
needs.&nbsp;
<br>This enable students to connect classroom learning with real life-applications
and evoke their curiosity in learning.</p>
