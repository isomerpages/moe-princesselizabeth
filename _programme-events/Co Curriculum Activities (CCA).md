<h3>Purpose of CCA @ PEPS</h3>
<p><strong>ASPIRE Champions of Character</strong>
</p>
<p>At Princess Elizabeth Primary School (PEPS), students are at the heart
of our efforts in developing their character.</p>
<p>CCA @ PEPS aims to develop them to be&nbsp;<strong>Champions of Character</strong>&nbsp;instilled
with School&nbsp;<strong>ASPIRE</strong>&nbsp;values to lead and serve
through their interests and talents.</p>
<p><strong>As ASPIRE Champions of Character, students:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>discover their interests and talents while developing values and competencies
that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lead and promote friendships among peers from diverse backgrounds as they
learn, play and grow together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>foster social integration and deepens their sense of belonging, commitment
and responsibility to our school community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>We believe:</em></strong>

<p>A student who <strong>champions character </strong>can inspire a team,</p>
