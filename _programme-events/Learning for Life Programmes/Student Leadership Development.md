<h3>Head of Department</h3><p>Mdm Shanthi Govindasamy</p><h3>Subject Head - Student Leadership &amp; VIA</h3><p>Ms Nur Diana Binte Abd Rahman</p><h3>Student Leadership Development</h3><p>Aligned with our vision,&nbsp;‘Every Child a Steadfast Leader’&nbsp;and our philosophy that&nbsp;“Everyone can learn, love and&nbsp;lead’, we strive towards inculcating the school core values (Ambition,&nbsp;Self-discipline,&nbsp;Perseverance,&nbsp;Integrity,&nbsp;Respect,&nbsp;Empathy) through&nbsp;student leadership&nbsp;development and&nbsp;community service.</p><p>Since 2017, Princess Elizabeth Primary School aims to provide every child an opportunity within each year to develop his/her leadership skills to be a steadfast leader with a heart of service to impact self, school or community as part of our Learning for Life (LLP) Programme.</p><p>The three broad dimensions of leadership, namely self, team and thought, are calibrated in our school programmes to ensure the holistic development of each student. On top of that, our approach to leadership focuses on cultivation of values and positive dispositions in students.</p><p>As such, student leaders are provided are developed through a segmented training approach to cater to the needs and expectations of students across the levels. It also seeks to ensure a progressive approach to the development of social-emotional competencies among the students. Eventually, the specially designed programmes provide student leaders with opportunities to extend their learning and apply what they have learnt in the school community, local community and global community.</p><h3>Student Leadership Development Framework - Values</h3><p>At the centre of the Student Leadership Framework is the school’s core values,&nbsp;ASPIRE, namely&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>mbition,&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>elf-Discipline,&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>erseverance,&nbsp;<strong>I</strong>ntegrity,&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>espect and&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>mpathy.</p><p>These core values serve as a compass for every student in the school, especially for our student leaders who use them as guiding principles in the leadership endeavours.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:50%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Framework.jpg"></div><h3>Student Leadership Development Framework - Approaches</h3><p>Three main approaches are adopted by the school in our student leadership development. They are Executive Functioning Skills, Servant Leadership and Inclusive Design.</p><p>Developing students’ executive functioning skills also develops students’ self-leadership and Everyday Leadership skills. These two are of utmost importance as students strive towards improvement to be the best version of themselves.</p><p>‘Serving is leading’ is Servant Leadership’s underlying philosophy. It involves a set of practices that enriches the lives of individuals, and ultimately creates a more just and caring world. Our student leaders serve to lead and lead to serve others around them.</p><p>Inclusive design encourages students to empathize with others while helping them develop a growth mindset and important problem solving and thinking skills. More than a product-based outcome, it is also an ongoing reflective process for the student leaders.</p><h3>Student Leadership Development Framework - Outcomes</h3><p>We aim for our student leaders to be able to proudly say&nbsp;iLEAD&nbsp;@ PEPS.</p><p>I&nbsp;Listen/Learn,&nbsp;Empathize/Empowered and&nbsp;Actively&nbsp;Do.</p><p>PEPS’ student leaders make positive and valuable impacts on themselves, the school and/or the community through various opportunities in the following leadership roles:</p><p>1.Group Leader&nbsp;</p><p>2.Subject Champ</p><p>3.Primary 2 Student Champ</p><p>4.Class Monitor</p><p>5.CyberPals</p><p>6.Peer Support Leader</p><p>7.CCA Leader</p><p>8.Prefect</p><p>Our student leaders’ community and global awareness is developed through their leadership roles and designated school leadership programs. This is part of equipping students with emerging 21st century competencies.</p><h3>Mass Students Leaders' Training Goes Online in light of COVID-19</h3><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SLD1.png"></div><h3>Prefects' Training when face-to-face trainings were allowed before we had to go back to e-training</h3><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SLD2.png"></div><h3>Online Head Prefect Campaign and Student Leadership Investiture</h3><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SLD3.png"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SLD4.jpg"></div><h3>Primary 6 Prefects VIA Project 2021 - Charity Donation Drive</h3><p>Our Primary 6 prefects organised and ran a donation drive as part of their post-PSLE activity, applying what they have learnt earlier in the year during their Project Management workshop as part of the Student Leadership training programme.</p><p>There are two target groups for this VIA project, children in need and migrant workers. The 4-day donation drive to collect food and household items/toiletries benefited two organisations, Sunbeam Place @ Singapore Children’s Society and Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (HOME) Shelter.</p><p>Our student leaders&nbsp;spent a lot of time sorting, checking and packing the donated items by the school community. At the end of the 4-day donation drive, the donated items were delivered personally by our teachers to both organisations. Each organisation received one van-full load of donated items.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SLD5.png"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SLD6.png"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SLD7.png"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SLD8.png"></div><p></p>
