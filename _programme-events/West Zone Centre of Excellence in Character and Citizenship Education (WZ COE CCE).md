At Princess Elizabeth Primary School, students are at the heart of our efforts in developing character development. These efforts have been affirmed by the Ministry of Education who accorded the school with the Outstanding Development Award (Character Development) and designated the school as a Centre of Excellence in Character and Citizenship Education (COE CCE) together with Greenridge Primary School.  

From 2019, the general direction of the COE CCE is to strengthen resilience and well-being of students by leveraging the strengths of the two schools, teacher-leaders/MOE HQ and the expertise of COE CCE reps from West Zone schools. As the WZ COE CCE, PEPS serves as one of the anchor schools in the West Zone to identify the professional teaching and learning needs in CCE of West Zone teachers and to develop pedagogical solutions to meet the four goals of CCE.

The COE CCE adopts a 3-part approach to ensure deep learning of staff in the teaching of CCE. Through this approach, we hope to strengthen the pedagogical content knowledge in the teaching and learning of CCE and develop more aspiring Teacher-Leaders.
