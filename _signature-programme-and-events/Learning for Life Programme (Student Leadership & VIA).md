Learning for Life programmes introduced to create “a colourful landscape of distinctive schools to choose from”, as the former Education Minister Heng Swee Keat had put it. Learning for Life programmes are meant to instill life skills and socio-emotional competencies in various areas. In Princess Elizabeth Primary School, student leadership is the school Learning for Life Programme (LLP).

In alignment with the School Vision, ‘Every Child an Engaged Learner, a Caring Citizen and a Steadfast Leader’, the focus of LLP would be on inculcating the School Core Values (Ambition, Self-discipline, Perseverance, Integrity, Respect, Empathy) through community service (Values in Action) and student leadership development, developing servant leaders who focus on the growth and well-being of people and the communities to which they belong.
