### Student Leadership Development

Aligned with our vision, ‘Every Child a Steadfast Leader’ and our philosophy that “Everyone can learn, love and lead’, we strive towards inculcating the school core values (Ambition, Self-discipline, Perseverance, Integrity, Respect, Empathy) through student leadership development and community service.

  

Since 2017, Princess Elizabeth Primary School aims to provide every child an opportunity within each year to develop his/her leadership skills to be a steadfast leader with a heart of service to impact self, school or community as part of our Learning for Life (LLP) Programme.

  

The three broad dimensions of leadership, namely self, team and thought, are calibrated in our school programmes to ensure the holistic development of each student. On top of that, our approach to leadership focuses on cultivation of values and positive dispositions in students.

As such, student leaders are provided are developed through a segmented training approach to cater to the needs and expectations of students across the levels. It also seeks to ensure a progressive approach to the development of social-emotional competencies among the students. Eventually, the specially designed programmes provide student leaders with opportunities to extend their learning and apply what they have learnt in the school community, local community and global community.

  

### Student Leadership Development Framework - Values

At the centre of the Student Leadership Framework is the school’s core values, ASPIRE, namely **A**mbition, **S**elf-Discipline, **P**erseverance, **I**ntegrity, **R**espect and **E**mpathy.  
  
These core values serve as a compass for every student in the school, especially for our student leaders who use them as guiding principles in the leadership endeavours.
