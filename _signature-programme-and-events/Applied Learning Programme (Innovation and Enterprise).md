### Focus Area: Innovation and Enterprise  

Using the inclusive design thinking approach in our ALP to foster in our students the value of empathy and resilience, students learn to be innovative and design creative solutions to real world problems which meet the needs of people in the process of ideation, experimentation and problem-solving. The approach is an amalgamation of the culture of care and innovation, and is a process that develops values and skills in our students and staff through human-centered techniques to solve real-world problems in creative and innovative ways for diverse groups of people.

Using Design Thinking approach, students interview their peers, school attendant, the canteen vendors or community members to find out more about their needs. Through this, students learn to empathise with their users and thereafter create interesting prototypes in order to meet the users' needs.   
This enable students to connect classroom learning with real life-applications and evoke their curiosity in learning.
