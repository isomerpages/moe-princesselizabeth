<h3>Hot weather management</h3>
<p>Due to the current hot weather recently, we hope to take steps to ensure
our students stay cool and comfortable while they are in school.</p>
<p><strong>Starting from Monday, 1 April 2024, students will be allowed to wear their PE attire to school</strong>.
While such provisions are made for your child’s comfort, we seek your help
to ensure your child is always neat and presentable. We will monitor and
review such arrangements in due course.</p>
<h3>Weighted Assessment 2</h3>
<p>Weighted Assessment 2 for <strong>Primary 3 to 6 students</strong> will
be conducted <strong>from 6 to 10 May 2024</strong>. Please refer to the <u>PG notification dated 9 April 2024</u> for
the schedule of your child’s class assessments. Please ensure your child
is present for the assessments and should they be absent without a valid
reason, your child would be marked as absent without a valid reason.</p>
<p><strong>Primary 6 students</strong> would be having non-weighted assessment
practices in Term 2 to help them prepare for their upcoming Preliminary
Examination and Primary School Leaving Examination in Term 3.</p>
