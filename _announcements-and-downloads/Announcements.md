<h3>Homecoming for Former Students to celebrate Teachers’ Day on 29 Aug 2024</h3>
<p>Dear Former Students of PEPS,</p>
<p>We are pleased to welcome all former students into the school on 29 August
2024 from <strong>12.45 pm and 2.00 pm in the school hall</strong>.</p>
<p>Teacher’s Day is a day of celebration for your teachers. To make the visit
enjoyable for everyone, we hope you will note the following guidelines:</p>
<p>• Please wear your school uniform/official PE attire to show pride and
respect for your secondary school.</p>
<p>• Entry and exit to the school will only be <strong><u>by the school main gate</u></strong>.
We will start admitting students into the school at <strong><u>12.40 pm</u></strong>.</p>
<p>• Be gracious and polite and spend some time catching up with your teachers
and ex schoolmates.</p>
<p>• Stay only in the school hall. All other areas, e.g., basketball court,
Princess Court, staff room, are out of bounds.</p>
<p>• Keep the school grounds clean.</p>
<p>• Leave the school at <strong><u>2.00 pm</u></strong> as your teachers have
their celebration. It is after all, a day for our teachers!</p>
<p>Only former students of PEPS are allowed to be in the school. Therefore,
the friends you invite into PEPS will be escorted out of the school premises
with you.</p>
<p>Let’s all make the experience a very memorable one for our teachers and
everyone in PEPS.</p>
