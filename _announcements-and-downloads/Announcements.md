<h4>Chinese New Year 2024</h4>
<p>We will be celebrating Chinese New Year on <strong>Friday, 9 February 2024</strong>.Together
with 20 seniors from the Lion’s Befrienders Organisation, our students
will be enjoying a concert and engage in festive activities.</p>
<p>As there will not be any lessons on that day, all students are encouraged
to bring a small bag that can contain stationery and some upcycling materials
as informed by their teacher. The canteen will also be closed on that day.
Parents can pack a small snack for your child if necessary.</p>
<p>Please note that on this day, your child can put on his/her Chinese traditional
costume or red top to school. If your child is wearing a red top, he/she
will need to put on the school shorts/skirt. Please also note that only
school shoes and socks are allowed on this day.</p>
