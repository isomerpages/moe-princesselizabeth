### National Day Celebrations 2023

We will be celebrating National Day on **Tuesday, 8 August 2023**. This year, the theme for NDP 2023 is “Onward as One”.

It calls upon Singaporeans to look forward confidently and move onward together in building our shared future as one united people.

As part of PEPS and MK@ Princess Elizabeth National Day #OOTD Contest, students are encouraged to dress in their best National Day Red and White Outfit of the Day (OOTD). PEPS bursting with white and red colours – what better way to show our love for our country. So go all out; let your child come in red and white face paint, temporary National Day-related tattoos and bring the National Flag to wave in the air. 

Let your child’s OOTD represent their national pride. It is time to bring on the patriotic fun in PEPS! There will be a mini competition to select the best dressed students.
As part of Family Time activity, you are invited to upload pictures on how you and your child celebrate National Day with your loved ones via the following Padlet Wall link or QR Code:

We would like all parents to refer to the PG notification and take note of the dates when your child would be having their class assessments for the various subjects.<br> Please ensure your child is present for the assessments and should they be absent without a valid reason, your child would be marked as absent without a valid reason.

(Refer to PG Notification which has already been sent to you for more details).

### Timed Practice For Primary 6
The school organised Timed Practice sessions for the Primary 6 students on Wednesday afternoons from 2 pm to 4 pm to familiarize with themselves with examination conditions and help them stay composed and collected during the examination. Doing the Timed Practice will help them to determine topics they know and areas they need to focus on.

### Parent Teacher Meeting (PTM)
PTM would be held on **30 August, from 8am to 4pm**, for all levels. Parents from all levels would be invited to book their slots to meet up with your child’s Form Teachers. More details on the PTM will be shared with parents closer to the date.
