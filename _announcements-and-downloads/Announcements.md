<h3>Health, Safety and Security</h3>
<p>We are committed to providing our students with a safe and secure environment
to ensure quality learning. We kindly request parents not to send their
child or ward to school if they are unwell or experiencing flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>As part of our emergency preparedness exercise, we will conduct a <strong>temperature-taking exercise on Wednesday 15 January 2025. We ask for your assistance in ensuring that your child or ward brings their thermometer to school on this day.</strong>
</p>
<p>Throughout the year, our school will also practice fire evacuation and
lock-down drills. These emergency drills will be conducted progressively
to enhance our preparedness.</p>
<h3>Traffic lockdown during dismissal</h3>
<p>To ensure the safety of our students during dismissal, there will be <strong>daily traffic lockdown from 1:25 PM to 1:45 PM</strong>.
This measure aims to create a controlled environment, significantly reducing
the risk of vehicular-pedestrian accidents. <strong>During this 20-minute period, there will be strictly no vehicle entry to the school premises</strong>.
We kindly request your understanding and cooperation in this matter. We
appreciate your support in prioritising the safety of our school community.</p>
<h3>Chinese New Year Celebrations</h3>
<p>Please note that Chinese New Year will be <strong>celebrated on Tuesday 28 January during curriculum time between 7:30am to 10:30am. Students will be dismissed at 10:30am.</strong> Please
note that Wednesday, 29 January and Thursday 30 January will be a public
holiday. School will be closed, including the General Office and Student
Care Centre (Big Heart) on these 2 days. All students will return to school
on Friday 31 January.</p>
