<h3>Hot weather management</h3>
<p>Due to the current hot weather recently, we hope to take steps to ensure
our students stay cool and comfortable while they are in school.</p>
<p><strong>Starting from Monday, 1 April 2024, students will be allowed to wear their PE attire to school</strong>.
While such provisions are made for your child’s comfort, we seek your help
to ensure your child is always neat and presentable. We will monitor and
review such arrangements in due course.</p>
<h3>Health, Safety and Security</h3>
<p>We are committed to providing our students with a safe and secure environment
to facilitate quality learning. In line with this commitment, we kindly
seek your support in ensuring the well-being of all students. We urge parents <strong>not to send your child/ward to school if he/she is unwell or exhibiting flu-like symptoms</strong>.
This precautionary measure is essential in safeguarding the health of our
school community.</p>
<p>As part of our emergency preparedness exercise, we will be conducting
a <strong>temperature-taking exercise on Wednesday, 3 July 2024</strong>.
To facilitate this process, <strong>we kindly request that your child/ward brings his/her personal thermometer to school on the specified date</strong>.
Your cooperation in this matter is deeply appreciated, and it plays a vital
role in our collective efforts to maintain a safe and healthy environment
for all members of our school community.</p>
<h3>Language and Cultural Fortnight</h3>
<p>The Language and Cultural Fortnight will be taking place from <strong>8 to 19 July 2024</strong>.
This event aims at promoting both the English and Mother Tongue languages
as well as to enhance students’ understanding of the different cultures.
Students will be actively engaged in their learning during English and
Mother Tongue Language lessons.</p>
<p>In addition, as part of our school’s efforts in promoting a reading culture, <strong>Characters Alive Day will be held on Monday, 8 July 2024, in which all students are invited to dress up as book characters</strong>.
Students are encouraged to use recycled materials to make their props/character
costumes. They can select fiction or non-fiction characters from English
and Mother Tongue books. Alternatively, they may also dress up as historical
characters they have learnt about in Social Studies lessons and books.</p>
<p>We seek parents’ cooperation to help your children collect recycled materials
during the June holidays so that they can start making their props and
costumes. We look forward to seeing our students all dressed up for Characters
Alive Day on 8 July!</p>
