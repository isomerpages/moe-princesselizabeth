<h3>Hot weather management</h3>
<p>Due to the current hot weather recently, we hope to take steps to ensure
our students stay cool and comfortable while they are in school.</p>
<p><strong>Starting from Monday, 1 April 2024, students will be allowed to wear their PE attire to school</strong>.
While such provisions are made for your child’s comfort, we seek your help
to ensure your child is always neat and presentable. We will monitor and
review such arrangements in due course.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Primary 5 Cohort Camp at Dairy Farm Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre</h3>
<p>Primary 5 students would be having their <strong>3D2N</strong> cohort camp
from <strong>25 April – 27 April 2024</strong>. Students will <strong>report to school at 7.30am on 25 April</strong> and
be <strong>dismissed at 11.30am on 27 April 2024.</strong>
</p>
<p>More details would be made known to the students in due course.</p>
<h3>Weighted Assessment 2</h3>
<p>Students from <strong>Primary 3 to 5 would be having their Weighted Assessment 2 in the month of May</strong> and
we would like all parents to refer to the PG notification and take note
of the dates when your child would be having their class assessments for
the various subjects.</p>
<p>Please ensure your child is present for the assessments and should they
be absent without a valid reason, your child would be marked as absent
without a valid reason.</p>
<p><strong>Primary 6 students would be having non-weighted assessment practices in Term 2</strong> to
help them prepare for their upcoming Preliminary Examination and Primary
School Leaving Examination in Term 3.</p>
