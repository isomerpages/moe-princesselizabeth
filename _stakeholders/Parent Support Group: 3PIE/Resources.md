Dear Parents,

In 2019, HPB is launching a series of educational articles for parents, which include topics such as nutrition, physical activity, mental wellness and even sleep! These articles are specifically curated to guide parents on healthy tricks and treats to guide them in their daily activities with their children.
 
 For a start, there are two articles on **[(1) Managing Transition](/files/ManagingTransition.pdf)** and **[(2) Sleep](/files/Sleep.pdf).** These articles aim to help parents learn the right skills, lifestyle habit changes during the transition phase, and important sleep tips.
 
Do stay tuned for the upcoming articles in this series, and we hope that parents will benefit from them!

  

Dear parents,

Here are some tips which can guide you to help your children to express themselves appropriately online.
