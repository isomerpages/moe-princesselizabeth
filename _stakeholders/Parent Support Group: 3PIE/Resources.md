<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p>In 2019, HPB is launching a series of educational articles for parents,
which include topics such as nutrition, physical activity, mental wellness
and even sleep! These articles are specifically curated to guide parents
on healthy tricks and treats to guide them in their daily activities with
their children.</p>
<p>For a start, there are two articles on&nbsp;<strong><a href="/files/ManagingTransition.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">(1) Managing Transition</a></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a href="/files/Sleep.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">(2) Sleep</a>.</strong>&nbsp;These
articles aim to help parents learn the right skills, lifestyle habit changes
during the transition phase, and important sleep tips.</p>
<p>Do stay tuned for the upcoming articles in this series, and we hope that
parents will benefit from them!</p>
<p>Dear parents,</p>
