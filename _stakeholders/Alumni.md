#### Teacher's Day 2023

Dear ex-students of PEPS,<br>

We are pleased to welcome all ex-students into the school on 31 August between 12:30 pm and 2.00 pm in the school hall.

Teacher’s Day is a day of celebration for your teachers. To make the visit enjoyable for everyone, we hope you will note the following guidelines:

* Please wear your school uniform/official PE attire to show pride and respect for your secondary school.
* Entry and exit to the school will only be by the school main gate. We will start admitting students into the school at 12:25 pm.
* Be gracious and polite and spend some time catching up with your teachers and exschoolmates.
* Stay only in the school hall. All other areas, e.g., basketball court, Princess Court, staff
room, are out of bounds.
* Keep the school grounds clean.
* Leave the school at 2.00 pm as your teachers have their celebration. It is after all, a day for our teachers!

Only ex-students of PEPS are allowed to be in the school. Therefore, the friends you invite into PEPS will be escorted out of the school premises with you.

Let’s all make the experience a very memorable one for our teachers and everyone in PEPS.

Thank you!
