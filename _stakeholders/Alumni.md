<p>Dear Ex-students of PEPS,</p>
<p>We are pleased to welcome all ex-students into the school on <strong>4 September 2025</strong> between <strong>12.45 pm and 2.00 pm in the school hall</strong>.</p>
<p>Teacher’s Day is a day of celebration for your teachers. To make the visit
enjoyable for everyone, we hope you will note the following guidelines:</p>
<p>∙ Please wear your school uniform/official PE attire to show pride and
respect for your secondary school.</p>
<p>∙ Entry and exit to the school will be <strong>by the school main gate and gate 4</strong>.
We will start admitting students into the school at <strong>12.40 pm</strong>.</p>
<p>∙ Be gracious and polite and spend some time catching up with your teachers
and ex-schoolmates.</p>
<p>∙ Stay only in the school hall. All other areas, e.g., basketball court,
Princess Court, staff room, are out of bounds.</p>
<p>∙ Keep the school grounds clean.</p>
<p>∙ Leave the school at <strong>2.00 pm</strong> as your teachers have their
celebration. It is after all, a day for our teachers!</p>
<p>Only ex-students of PEPS are allowed to be in the school. Therefore, the
friends you invite into PEPS will be escorted out of the school premises
with you.</p>
<p>Let’s all make the experience a very memorable one for our teachers and
everyone in PEPS.</p>
<p></p>
