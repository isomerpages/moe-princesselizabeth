Dear Ex-students of PEPS

Please note that the school premises will be used during the 2023 Presidential Elections. **Hence, we will not be allowing our former students to visit our teachers on 31 August**. We apologise for the inconvenience caused. We thank all ex-students for your kind thoughts.

We seek your understanding in this. We hope that you can find other creative ways such as doing a video message with your friends to appreciate your ex-teachers! Do send it to us. We will be delighted to show it to all on 31 Aug when we have our online Teachersâ€™ Day celebration with our current students.

Thank you!

Mdm Malar<br>
Member of PEPS Alumni committee
