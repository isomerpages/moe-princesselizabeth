**Parent Volunteer (PV) Application** <br>

Princess Elizabeth Primary School values our Parent Volunteers' contribution to the school and welcomes all interested parents to apply as Parent Volunteers under our Parent Volunteer Scheme.

Under this Parent Volunteer Scheme, a parent may be able to register his/her child under Phase 2B of the Primary One Registration Exercise if he/she meets the following criteria:

a)    Parent and his/her child are Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents. <br>
b)    Parent has joined the school as a Parent Volunteer and has contributed at least forty (40) hours of voluntary service to the school before June the year the child is due for P1 registration.

Please note your child is not guaranteed a place in Princess Elizabeth Primary School under Phase 2B of the Primary 1 Registration Exercise even with the completion of minimum forty (40) hours of voluntary services.

Balloting will be conducted should the number of applications (including active community leaders) exceed the number of vacancies. Priority will be given in the following order:

1\. Children who are Singapore Citizens <br>
2\. Children who are Singapore Permanent Residents.

Within each of the above categories, balloting will be conducted if applications exceed the number of vacancies. Places will be balloted according to the order of priority based on home-school distance categories, i.e. within 1km, between 1 and 2km and outside 2km.

For more details and latest information on Phase 2B eligibility, please refer to the MOE website at

The selection of Parent Volunteers is not on a first-come, first-served basis. The school reserves the right to select applicants whose services meet the needs of the school and our students. In view of the 5-day work week, voluntary services that can be performed during weekdays and are most beneficial to the school and our students will be considered first.

Please note that only successful applicants will be notified. The decision of the school in the selection of Parent Volunteers is final and the school is not obliged to give any reason for unsuccessful application.
