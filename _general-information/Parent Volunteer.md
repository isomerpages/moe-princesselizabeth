<p><strong>Parent Volunteer (PV) Application</strong> 
<br>
<br>Princess Elizabeth Primary School values our Parent Volunteers' contribution
to the school and welcomes all interested parents to apply as Parent Volunteers
under our Parent Volunteer Scheme.</p>
<p>Under this Parent Volunteer Scheme, a parent may be able to register his/her
child under Phase 2B of the Primary One Registration Exercise if he/she
meets the following criteria:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parent and his/her
child are Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parent has joined the school
as a Parent Volunteer and has contributed at least forty (40) hours of
voluntary service to the school before June the year the child is due for
P1 registration.</p>
<p>Please note your child is not guaranteed a place in Princess Elizabeth
Primary School under Phase 2B of the Primary 1 Registration Exercise even
with the completion of minimum forty (40) hours of voluntary services.</p>
<p>Balloting will be conducted should the number of applications (including
active community leaders) exceed the number of vacancies. Priority will
be given in the following order:</p>
<p>1. Children who are Singapore Citizens
<br>2. Children who are Singapore Permanent Residents.</p>
<p>Within each of the above categories, balloting will be conducted if applications
exceed the number of vacancies. Places will be balloted according to the
order of priority based on home-school distance categories, i.e. within
1km, between 1 and 2km and outside 2km.</p>

week, voluntary services that can be performed during weekdays and are
most beneficial to the school and our students will be considered first.</p>

decision of the school in the selection of Parent Volunteers is final and
the school is not obliged to give any reason for unsuccessful application.</p>
