Singapore Permanent Residents.

and has contributed at least forty (40) hours of voluntary service to the
school before June the year the child is due for P1 registration.</p>
<p>Please note your child is not guaranteed a place in Princess Elizabeth
Primary School under Phase 2B of the Primary 1 Registration Exercise even
with the completion of minimum forty (40) hours of voluntary services.</p>
<p>Balloting will be conducted should the number of applications (including
active community leaders) exceed the number of vacancies. Priority will
be given in the following order:</p>

<p>Within each of the above categories, balloting will be conducted if applications
exceed the number of vacancies. Places will be balloted according to the

most beneficial to the school and our students will be considered first.</p>

decision of the school in the selection of Parent Volunteers is final and
the school is not obliged to give any reason for unsuccessful application.</p>
