### Recess  
  

The canteen serves only the students and staff of the school. Students should not run or play in the canteen. Students are to return all receptacles and utensils after use so that the next person can sit at a clean table. Students are to keep the canteen clean. Hygiene in the canteen is important to health.

### School Car Park  
  

Due to the limited space within the school, the car park is strictly for staff use. For the security and safety of all students, no vehicles will be allowed to enter the school premises during school hours except for official business.

### Visitors to the School  

For security reasons, all visitors are required to furnish their names and identification documents at the guard post to obtain a "Visitor Pass". Visitors will then need to proceed to the General Office.

To inculcate a sense of personal responsibility in our students, the school will not accept from parents or guardians any items, except medications that the students have forgotten to bring.

Parents' / Guardians' Particulars  
  

It is important for parents/guardians to update the school of the changes in their addresses and /or contact numbers so that the school is able to contact parties concerned in the event of an emergency.

If your child/ward has a medical condition or allergy, it is strongly advised that certification from a doctor be handed to the school immediately.

### Communication Channel with the School  

Parents Gateway is a mobile app designed to allow the school and parents to stay connected. For timely updates, parents are strongly encouraged to check for notifications at least once a week on the phone. Your child's travel declaration can also be updated via this app. Further details can be found at https://pg.moe.edu.sg.

### Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS)  


The Financial Assistance Scheme aims to reduce the financial burden of needy students so that they can focus on their academic pursuit.
