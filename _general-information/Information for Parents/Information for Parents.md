<h3>Recess</h3>
<p>The canteen serves only the students and staff of the school. Students
should not run or play in the canteen. Students are to return all receptacles
and utensils after use so that the next person can sit at a clean table.
Students are to keep the canteen clean. Hygiene in the canteen is important
to health.</p>
<h3>School Car Park</h3>
<p>Due to the limited space within the school, the car park is strictly for
staff use. For the security and safety of all students, no vehicles will
be allowed to enter the school premises during school hours except for
official business.</p>
<h3>Visitors to the School</h3>
<p>The school follows the guidelines provided by MOE with regards to visitor
management procedures. The school requires all visitors to make an official
appointment before visiting the school. Visitors are only allowed to enter
from Main Gate.</p>
<p>All visitors to the school need to register at the Security Guard Post
upon arrival at the school. Those who have official appointments with valid
purpose(s) will be issued with a visitor’s label upon producing their identity
card for verification. Visitors are required to put on the visitor’s label
and proceed directly to the General Office. Parents are prohibited from
going to the classroom, staff room or canteen on their own.</p>
<p>Please note that there will be daily traffic lockdown during school dismissal
from 1:25 PM to 1:45 PM. During this 20-minute period, there will be strictly
no vehicle entry to the school premises.</p>
<p>To inculcate a sense of personal responsibility in our students, the school
will not accept from parents or guardians any items, except medications
that the students have forgotten to bring.</p>
<p><strong>Parents' / Guardians' Particulars</strong>
</p>
<p>It is important for parents/guardians to update the school of the changes
in their addresses and /or contact numbers so that the school is able to
contact parties concerned in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p>If your child/ward has a medical condition or allergy, it is strongly
advised that certification from a doctor be handed to the school immediately.</p>
<h3>Communication Channel with the School</h3>
<p>Parents Gateway is a mobile app designed to allow the school and parents
to stay connected. For timely updates, parents are strongly encouraged
to check for notifications at least once a week on the phone. Your child's
travel declaration can also be updated via this app. Further details can
be found at https://pg.moe.edu.sg.</p>
<h3>Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS)</h3>
<p>The Financial Assistance Scheme aims to reduce the financial burden of
needy students so that they can focus on their academic pursuit. Students
who have difficulty in meeting their schooling needs may apply for the
MOE Financial Assistance Scheme. Please refer to the following website
for more information:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance</a>
</p>
<p>If the students are not eligible for MOE FAS, the school may consider
them for School-based FAS (with different benefits from that offered under
MOE FAS). Please call the school for more information when the need arises.</p>
<p>Direct School Admission (DSA) Application (For Parents / Guardians of
P6 Students)</p>
<p>The school will distribute information notes and brochure of the above-mentioned

and be familiar with the time frame as well as the corresponding actions
to be taken, should you want your child/ward to participate in the DSA
exercise.</p>
