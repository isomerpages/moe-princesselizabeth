### Recess  
  

The canteen serves only the students and staff of the school. Students should not run or play in the canteen. Students are to return all receptacles and utensils after use so that the next person can sit at a clean table. Students are to keep the canteen clean. Hygiene in the canteen is important to health.

### School Car Park  
  

Due to the limited space within the school, the car park is strictly for staff use. For the security and safety of all students, no vehicles will be allowed to enter the school premises during school hours except for official business.

### Visitors to the School  

The school follows the guidelines provided by MOE with regards to visitor management procedures. The school requires all visitors to make an official appointment before visiting the school. Visitors are only allowed to enter from Main Gate.

All visitors to the school need to register at the Security Guard Post upon arrival at the school. Those who have official appointments with valid purpose(s) will be issued with a visitor’s label upon producing their identity card for verification. Visitors are required to put on the visitor’s label and proceed directly to the General Office. Parents are prohibited from going to the classroom, staff room or canteen on their own.

To inculcate a sense of personal responsibility in our students, the school will not accept from parents or guardians any items, except medications that the students have forgotten to bring.

**Parents' / Guardians' Particulars**

It is important for parents/guardians to update the school of the changes in their addresses and /or contact numbers so that the school is able to contact parties concerned in the event of an emergency.

If your child/ward has a medical condition or allergy, it is strongly advised that certification from a doctor be handed to the school immediately.

### Communication Channel with the School  

Parents Gateway is a mobile app designed to allow the school and parents to stay connected. For timely updates, parents are strongly encouraged to check for notifications at least once a week on the phone. Your child's travel declaration can also be updated via this app. Further details can be found at https://pg.moe.edu.sg.

### Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS)  


The Financial Assistance Scheme aims to reduce the financial burden of needy students so that they can focus on their academic pursuit.
