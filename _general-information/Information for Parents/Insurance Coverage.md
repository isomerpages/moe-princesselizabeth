<p>All students will be covered for accidents under MOE Group Personal Accident
(GPA) Insurance Plan for Students. Insurance coverage applies to accidents
that happen within the school premises and during school-related activities
outside school.</p>
<p><strong><em>Parents/guardians will have to pay for medical treatments upfront, before submitting claims to Income Insurance Limited (Income Insurance) for reimbursement. Please note the applicable limits and coverage for medical expenses. Ineligible expenses or expenses in excess of the limits will be borne by the students/parents/guardians.</em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>Parents/guardians should also take note that medical treatments at private hospitals will typically cost higher, and parents/guardians may need to pay more out-of-pocket expenses if treatment costs exceed the policy’s coverage</em></strong>
</p>
<h3>Summary of Claims Procedures</h3>
<p>All claims must be submitted online as soon as possible subjected to a
cap of 365 days from the date of accident.</p>
