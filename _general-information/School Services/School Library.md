### Vision

A vibrant resource hub that supports teaching and learning  



### Mission

Together, we nurture our students to develop good reading habits and become self-directed and lifelong learners.  

### Functions of School Library

1. It is a physical space that provides staff and students with fast and easy access to reliable and updated information through quality resources for teaching and learning.  
2. It plays a pivotal role in supporting the school curriculum and equipping students with knowledge and skills to develop them into independent and&nbsp;lifelong learners.  
3. It functions as a cultural nucleus, promoting an awareness of the studentsâ€™ heritage and an understanding of the diversity of the different cultures.  
4. Its environment is conducive to reading.
