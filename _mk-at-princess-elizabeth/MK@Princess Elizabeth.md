We are excited to share with you that MOE will be setting up an MOE Kindergarten (MK) within Princess Elizabeth Primary School (MK@PEPS). MK@PEPS will enrol Kindergarten 1 (K1) children from January 2023. 

MOE has been running MKs since 2014 to provide **_A Strong Start for Every Child_**. The MK Curriculum nurtures children holistically so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy. To date, there are 28 MKs across Singapore, with another 8 MKs starting operations each year in January 2021 and 2022.

The feedback from the parents of MK children has been consistently positive, affirming that their children have the confidence and social skills to adapt to Primary 1.

The siting of an MK in our school will offer enriched learning experiences for the school community. Our students will develop social and interpersonal skills by participating in joint activities with the younger children. These joint activities are also opportunities for our students to showcase their learning to the kindergarten children and to exercise their leadership skills when they guide the younger children. Our school teachers will also benefit from a mutual understanding of educational programmes in the MK and primary schools. Our school will be strongly supported by MOE HQ in the setting up of the MK. 

The day-to-day operations of the MK will be headed by a Centre Head and supported by a team of qualified kindergarten educators. The kindergarten children will have their own learning areas within our school compound.

The MOE Kindergarten registration exercise for 2023 K1 admission has closed.  If you wish to place your child on the MK@Princess Elizabeth Waitlist, please fill in the form at: [https://form.gov.sg/#!/620db865f620bd00132b67e8](https://form.gov.sg/#!/620db865f620bd00132b67e8).
