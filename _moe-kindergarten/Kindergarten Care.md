What is Kindergarten Care
-------------------------

Kindergarten Care (KCare) is available in all MOE Kindergartens (MK) located within primary schools.

If you register, your child can be in KCare before and after their MK session, providing the convenience of a full-day service.

KCare operates from Monday to Friday, 7am to 7pm, including school holidays. It is closed on public holidays and up to 6 additional days each year.

The programme includes meals as well as activities designed to provide time and space for children to play, explore and discover through:

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indoor and outdoor modular activities, such as tinkering, cookery and gardening activities. <br>
●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indoor and outdoor play, such as dramatic play, and sand and water play.
