**Birthday Celebration**

MK will celebrate the birthday of those children born in the month on the last Friday before the month ends. Celebrations will include a cake, birthday song and pictures of birthday children. All children will enjoy the cake for snack.

Parents are discouraged from preparing food-related items for goodie bags due to allergies and medical conditions of children. Stationery items and story books are good gifts for goodie bags. Do plan wisely and discuss with the class teacher before making your purchases.

**Unwell Child**

&nbsp;Health screening will be conducted daily upon arrival.
If your child has the following symptoms, please keep your child at home.

●&nbsp;high fever (above 37.5 ° C)<br>
●&nbsp;throat infection <br>
●&nbsp;conjunctivitis (sore eyes) <br>
●&nbsp;diarrhoea <br>
●&nbsp;vomiting <br>
●&nbsp;head lice <br>
●&nbsp;communicable diseases such as chicken pox, gastric flu, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, measles, mumps, rubella

Children who are unwell or have had recent contact with infected persons are strongly encouraged to self-test using an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kit.

**Important:** Children who return to kindergarten after recovering from an infectious disease but are still showing symptoms of illness (after the expiry of medical certification), will need to produce a certificate of health from the medical practitioner for the child to return to the kindergarten.

**MK teachers will not administer medication to your child or do the ART test**.
