<h3>Curriculum: Our Flagship Programmes</h3>
<p><strong>Starlight Literacy Program</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Early Childhood Literacy</strong>
</p>
<p>Language learning is a dynamic and ongoing process that begins in infancy
and early childhood and continues throughout the schooling years. In early
childhood, the focus is on developing children’s listening and speaking
skills. An active, interactive approach helps to nurture children’s interest
in learning languages.</p>
<p>We use Big Books, songs, rhymes and games to help your child to:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop listening, speaking and early
literacy skills.
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enjoy English and their Mother Tongue
Language (MTL) (i.e. Chinese, Malay or Tamil language).
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communicate with confidence.
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learn about local customs and traditions.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Mother Tongue Language (MTL) and Bilingualism</strong>
</p>
<p>Bilingualism is a cornerstone of Singapore’s education system. Learning
our MTL gives us direct access to our cultural heritage, and can help us
better understand our values, roots and identities.</p>
<p>At MK, we nurture bilingualism by focusing on listening, speaking and
engaging children in games and activities that encourage early literacy
development.</p>
<p>By using their MTL to communicate with teachers and their friends on a
daily basis, children build a strong foundation that will prepare them
for language learning in later years.</p>

<p>HI-Light Program</p>
<p><strong>Holistic development</strong>
</p>
<p>The HI-Light Programme is designed to support the holistic development
of children across these six learning areas through an integrated approach
to learning. It provides children opportunities to explore, discover and
learn about the world around them.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aesthetics and creative expression
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discovery of the world
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Language and literacy

<p>Weeks of Wonder (WoW) Projects</p>
<h3>Collaborative and Self-directed Learning</h3>
<p>Each term at MOE Kindergarten (MK) culminates in a Weeks of Wonder (WoW)
project. In a year, children complete 2 WoW projects in English and another
2 in their Mother Tongue Language (MTL). Children will work together with
their friends on a topic of their choice.</p>
<p>Through WoW projects, children learn how to:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make their own decisions
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; develop problem-solving, process and investigative
skills
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; collaborate with one another
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; communicate effectively in English and
their MTL
<br>
</p>
<p>Through the process of finding answers to their own questions, WoW projects
allow children to:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; experience the joy of self-motivated learning
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build their confidence
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strengthen their learning dispositions
or positive behaviours and attitudes towards learning
